CSE555-Nowcast
==============

Term project for CSE555 Visual Computing at Oakland University. An Arduino rain sensor is used to log current precipitation conditions. The current conditions will trigger a download for the last 4 hours of radar image data. With this data we can use optical flow to determine nowcast the precipitation. We will then compare our predictions back to the observed times.
